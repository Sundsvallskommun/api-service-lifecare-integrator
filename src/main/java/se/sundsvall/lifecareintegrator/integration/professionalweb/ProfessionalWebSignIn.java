/**
 * Signs the integrator in to Lifecare as its integration account.

 * Walks exactly the flow a caseworker's browser walks, only without a browser: open Lifecare's entry URL, follow the
 * redirects into the identity provider (MobilityGuard), submit the sign-in form, and post the resulting SAML assertion
 * back to Lifecare. Each hop's cookies are carried into the next, and what falls out at the end is a session Lifecare
 * recognises, proven by the LEGACY-TOKEN cookie.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * What it cannot do is answer a second factor. If the account is enrolled for a one-time code, or the identity
 * provider waits for something outside the page, the flow stops on a page it cannot satisfy and this throws.
