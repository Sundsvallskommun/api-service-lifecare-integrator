 * session with a status of its own (360) and with redirects that must be detected rather than followed, rotates its
 * cookies on ordinary calls, and walks sign-in through HTML forms. None of that fits a declarative client, so statuses
 * are read here rather than thrown, and redirects are never followed automatically.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Trust comes from the dept44 truststore, where Lifecare's internal CA is installed. No body is ever logged here:
 * everything that crosses this connection may hold personal data or credentials.
